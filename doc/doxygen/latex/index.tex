This is an application to make fractal videos based on Qt(6.\+2.\+0), C++ and FFmpeg.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md1}{}\doxysection{Version Information}\label{index_autotoc_md1}
This is version 6.\+0.\+9 updated in 2021/08/01.

{\bfseries{What\textquotesingle{}s new in beta1 version than alpha version}}\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Solve bugs listed in \href{https://github.com/T-V-J/Fractal_Designer/releases/tag/v6.0.9-alpha}{\texttt{ 6.\+0.\+9 Alpha Release}}.
\item Improve efficiency by up to 100\% than alpha version.
\end{DoxyItemize}

Current version is now only available for Windows. Release for Linux will be published in the near future.

Visit our \href{https://frd.teddy-van-jerry.org}{\texttt{ Fractal Designer Website}} for more information.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md2}{}\doxysection{Build the Project}\label{index_autotoc_md2}
Besides the build version for Windows (using Qt 6.\+2.\+0), you can compile it yourself by following steps\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Build project {\ttfamily include/qscintilla.\+pro} with both Debug and Release mode. Remember to uncheck {\itshape shadow build}.
\item Open project {\ttfamily src/\+Fractal\+\_\+\+Designer.\+pro} and {\itshape release translations} (lrelease). In Qt Creator, it is in {\ttfamily Tools-\/$>$External-\/$>$Qt Languist}.
\item Build {\ttfamily src/\+Fractal\+\_\+\+Designer.\+pro} with the same kit as that of building QScintilla. Also remember to uncheck {\itshape shadow build}.
\item To distribute the project, you need to
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Build in release mode.
\item Deploy with {\ttfamily windeployqt}, {\ttfamily macdeployqt}, {\ttfamily linuxdeployqt} or other methods to get the dependency files.
\item Copy the release dynamic library file of QScintilla ({\ttfamily qscintilla2\+\_\+qt6.\+dll} in Windows) to directory {\ttfamily bin} and delete directory {\ttfamily lib}, {\ttfamily scintilla}, {\ttfamily include}, {\ttfamily tmp}.
\item Download \href{http://www.ffmpeg.org/download.html}{\texttt{ ffmpeg}} and put it in the right directory. (For Windows, it is {\ttfamily bin/win/ffmpeg.\+exe}.)
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md3}{}\doxysection{Use Fractal Designer}\label{index_autotoc_md3}
Type {\ttfamily help} in the terminal to get the list of all commands supported by Fractal Designer 6.\+0.\+9. Use the sample file to have a quick look at how the {\ttfamily frd} language is like. Details about {\ttfamily frd} language will be updated in the near future.\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md4}{}\doxysubsection{FRD Script}\label{index_autotoc_md4}
Here is the basic syntax of {\ttfamily frd} script\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily frd} language is case-\/sensitive.
\item Variable names are started with {\ttfamily \$}, function names are started with {\ttfamily \%} and class names are started with {\ttfamily @}.
\item Each statement is ended with {\ttfamily ;} or a block (i.\+e. {\ttfamily \{\}}).
\item Comments follow the {\ttfamily C++} rule (i.\+e. {\ttfamily //} and {\ttfamily /$\ast$ $\ast$/}).
\item No custom class name is allowed in this version.
\item Members of a class are specified also.
\item No quote mark is needed outside {\ttfamily @string} value.
\item To assign a {\ttfamily @formula} value, use {\ttfamily \+:=} instead of {\ttfamily =}.
\item Currently a value can only be set during initialization. (Which seems to a bug of {\ttfamily QJson})
\item Variables is only valid in its scope block.
\item {\ttfamily @number} values are acctually stored as complex numbers.
\item {\ttfamily @array} stores {\ttfamily @number} and {\ttfamily @list} stores {\ttfamily @string}.
\item {\ttfamily @array} and {\ttfamily @list} values are set by using {\ttfamily ,} to divide different elements. No {\ttfamily \{\}} should be used.
\item Function now only support {\ttfamily CONFIGURE}.
\end{DoxyItemize}

\begin{quote}
Note\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Non Ascii characters can lead to the misplace of syntax highlight of variable, function and class names.
\item Try to avoid syntax error or mathematics error. (For example, {\ttfamily Ts} in route should between 0 to 1 and {\ttfamily Widths} should not be negative.) The behavoir of the interpreter is undefined faced with these circumstances. {\itshape \mbox{[}This will be improved in the future.\mbox{]}} 
\end{DoxyItemize}\end{quote}
\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md5}{}\doxysubsection{FRD Terminal}\label{index_autotoc_md5}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Currently you just need to use the {\bfseries{Editor}} tab.
\item {\ttfamily Ctrl + O} to open {\ttfamily frd} files. (The default directory will have a sample file.)
\item Change the {\itshape file location} and {\itshape image size} information of sample file according to your need.
\item Enter {\ttfamily save} in terminal or use {\ttfamily Ctrl + S} to save your changes.
\item Enter {\ttfamily run} to interpret the script (Every time you change the file you need to {\ttfamily run} to get the data updated.)
\item Enter {\ttfamily preview} (or {\ttfamily F12}) to view the preview image and {\ttfamily closepreview} to close the preview window.
\item Enter {\ttfamily createimages} (or {\ttfamily Ctrl + R}) to create images. This process can be time-\/consuming.
\item Enter {\ttfamily createvideo} to create the video. This process is much faster than that of creating images but the window will not respond until this process finishes.
\item Other useful commands\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item {\ttfamily help} to view all commands. This can help you choose what command and argument to use.
\item {\ttfamily clear} to clear the screen.
\item {\ttfamily history} to view the command history.
\item {\ttfamily info} to view data stored in json format.
\item {\ttfamily !!} to repeat the previous command.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}\hypertarget{index_autotoc_md6}{}\doxysection{TODOs in Version 6.\+0}\label{index_autotoc_md6}

\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Validity Check in {\ttfamily frd} script.
\item Improve error indication of interpreter.
\item Add termination control in preview, creating images and creating video.
\item Add more terminal commands.
